# FairFight (FF)
A Lua to force a fair fight for stand.

<hr>  </hr>

Players you try to fight use RPGs, minigun, MK2 or some other skilless things?
<br>
**Then FF is the solution.**
</br>
In a matter of seconds, you can force them to fight you, with fair things. Or punish them if they don't.

### What is this?

Well this script is, like the name says, to fight fair. With that I mean you can do things to players that will _stop_ them from using certain gun groups, vehicles, passive mode and even _god mode_ (only works on some menus). <sub> <sup> There is more to explore :)</sup> </sub>
<br>
Now if they ***_still_*** try to use those things..
<br>
**You** decide what will happen by choosing between multiple punishments.
