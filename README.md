# FairFight (FF) ![version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Soon-v1.2-brigthgreen)

Players you try to fight use RPG, minigun, MK2 or some other things?
<br>
**Then FF is the solution.** ü§ì
</br>
With a few clicks, you can force them to fight you with fair materials. And punish them if they don't.

<hr>  </hr>

### What is this?

Well this script is, like the name says, to fight fair and help yourself with annoying stuff for example getting killed by random NPCs or Cops. <br>
There're multiple things you can do to players. Some are _stoping_ them from using certain gun groups, vehicles and even _god mode_ (only works on some menus).
<br>
Now if they ***_still_*** try to use those things..
**You** decide what will happen by choosing between multiple punishments.
<br>
<br>
But that is of corse not everything:grey_exclamation: <br>
**There is more to explore :)** :heavy_check_mark:
</br>
